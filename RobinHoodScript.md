# Robin Hood: Midnight Gold

**Opening Scene – Sherwood at Midnight**

The moon hangs low over Sherwood Forest. Owls call across the dark canopy.
You, Robin Hood, crouch near a mossy oak beside Little John and Maid Marian.
Scouts whisper that the Sheriff’s gold convoy will pass through the forest within the hour.
Your mission: outsmart the Sheriff and deliver the gold to Nottingham’s poor.

## Decision A – First Move
*A1* 
Scout the convoy first – Gather information before acting.

*A2* 
Set a trap immediately – Strike quickly before the Sheriff suspects anything.

## Branch A1 – Scout the Convoy

You slip through the trees like a shadow. From a ridge you see torches flicker:
four wagons of gold, guarded by a dozen soldiers. You overhear their route and timing.
You return to the hideout with this knowledge.

## Decision A1 – Next Tactic

*A1.B1* 
Ambush at the stone bridge – Use your new intel to set a perfect trap.

*A1.B2* 
Sneak into the camp at night – Try to steal the gold without a fight.

### Path A1.B1 – Ambush at the Bridge

The wagons clatter across the old stone bridge. At your signal, ropes snap tight.
The first cart overturns, blocking the way. Your archers rain arrows on the startled guards.
The Sheriff’s men surrender without a fight.

### Decision A1.B1 – Final Action

*A1.B1.End1*
Free the prisoners and send the gold to the poor.

*A1.B1.End2* 
Take a share and vanish into Sherwood.

**End1 Free the prisoners**
**Success**
Cheers rise in Nottingham as bread and coins feed every hungry family.
The people sing ballads of Robin Hood’s midnight victory.

**End2 Take a share and vanish**
**Failure**
Guards regroup and pursue.
The Sheriff swears vengeance, and the poor remain hungry.

## Path A1.B2 - Sneak into the Camp

Night falls. You creep into the Sheriff’s camp. A twig snaps under Little John’s boot.
The camp erupts in shouts and flashing steel.

### A1.B2 Decision Quick Escape or Fight

*A1.B2.End3* 
Fight

*A1.B2.End4* 
Escape empty-handed

**End3 Fight**
**Failure**
Outnumbered, you and your band are captured.

**End4 Escape** 
**Failure** 
You save your lives but lose the gold.

## Branch A2 – Set a Trap Immediately

Without scouting, you and your band rush to rig ropes and spikes along the forest road.
The night air hums with urgency. You hope you have chosen the right path.

### Decision A2 – Ambush Style

*A2.End5* 
Hide nearby and wait – Trust the trap.

*A2.B3*
Send Little John as a decoy – Try to draw the guards in.

**End5 Hide and Wait**
**Failure** 
The convoy looks like it will pass directly into your unscouted trap. The ropes tighten perfectly, overturning the first cart. However another highwayman ambushes them before you can get there and steals the gold. You would have seen them if you had checked more thoroughly. You leave with nothing.

### A2.B3 Send Little John as Decoy

Little John strolls into the road singing loudly. But the Sheriff anticipated the ploy: hidden crossbowmen leap from the shadows.

### A2.B3 
Decision – Last Stand or Surrender

*End3* 
Fight 

*End6*
Surrender 

**End3 Fight** 
**Failure** 
Outnumbered, you and your band are captured.

**End6 Surrender**
**Failure** 
Chains and the dungeon await.
